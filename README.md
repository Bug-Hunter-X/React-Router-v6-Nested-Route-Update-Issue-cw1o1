This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router v6 involving nested components and route updates.  The issue occurs when navigating between routes that share nested components.  The nested components don't always re-render with the correct data, leading to stale props or UI inconsistencies. The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a fix using the `useLocation` hook to force a re-render.
